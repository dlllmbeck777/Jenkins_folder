This does not seem supported in a scripted pipeline.

Using purely a declarative pipeline on an agent based on the docker-compose image (so with docker-compose preinstalled), I suppose you can shell script those commands directly:

stage('Build Docker Image') {  
    steps{                     
    sh 'docker-compose build'     
    echo 'Docker-compose-build Build Image Completed'                
    }           
}
And then login to DockerHub and push, as described in "Simple Jenkins Declarative Pipeline to Push Docker Image To Docker Hub"

stage('Login to Docker Hub') {          
    steps{                          
    sh 'echo $DOCKERHUB_CREDENTIALS_PSW | sudo docker login -u $DOCKERHUB_CREDENTIALS_USR --password-stdin'                     
    echo 'Login Completed'      
    }           
}
stage('Push Image to Docker Hub') {         
    steps{                            
 sh 'sudo docker push <dockerhubusername>/<dockerhubreponame>:$BUILD_NUMBER'           
echo 'Push Image Completed'       
    }            
}
